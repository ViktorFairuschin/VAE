# Unsupervised Learning of Image Representations with Deep Convolutional Variation Autoencoder 

This is a project I was working on during the Certified Artificial Intelligence Engineer training in December 2022. The code provided here is a tensorflow implementation of a deep concolutional variational autoencoder trained on the [Chicago Face Database](https://www.chicagofaces.org).
