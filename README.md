# Learning continuous latent spaces from high-dimensional data with deep convolutional variational autoencoders.

This is a project I was working on during the Certified Artificial Intelligence Engineer training from December 2022 to January 2023. The code provided here is a tensorflow implementation of a deep concolutional variational autoencoder trained on the [Chicago Face Database](https://www.chicagofaces.org).
